# Alink
Alink is a Flink-based algorithm platform independently developed by us. We hope to give back to the community through open source, affecting and driving the Flink community's development in AI. Now open the Alink framework and several representative Alink algorithm functions, the purpose is to communicate and discuss with peers outside the group, collect opinions and suggestions, improve Alink's design, and prepare for subsequent open source.

Alink为我们独立研发的基于Flink的算法平台，希望能通过开源的方式，回馈社区，影响和带动Flink社区在AI方面的发展。现在开放Alink框架及几个有代表性的Alink算法功能，目的是与集团外的同行进行交流和讨论，收集意见和建议，改进Alink的设计，为后续开源作准备。
